This method dominates many Kaggle competitions and achieves state-of-the-art results on a variety of datasets. \n\n# Introduction\n\nFor much of this course, you have made predictions with the random forest method, which achieves better performance than a single decision tree simply by averaging the predictions of many decision trees.\n\nWe refer to the random forest method as an \"ensemble method\".  By definition, **ensemble methods** combine the predictions of several models (e.g., several trees, in the case of random forests).  \n\nNext, we'll learn about another ensemble method called gradient boosting.  \n\n# Gradient Boosting\n\n**Gradient boosting** is a method that goes through cycles to iteratively add models into an ensemble.  \n\nIt begins by initializing the ensemble with a single model, whose predictions can be pretty naive.  (Even if its predictions are wildly inaccurate, subsequent additions to the ensemble will address those errors.)\n\nThen, we start the cycle:\n- First, we use the current ensemble to generate predictions for each observation in the dataset.  To make a prediction, we add the predictions from all models in the ensemble.  \n- These predictions are used to calculate a loss function (like [mean squared error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error), for instance).\n- Then, we use the loss function to fit a new model that will be added to the ensemble.  Specifically, we determine model parameters so that adding this new model to the ensemble will reduce the loss.  (*Side note: The \"gradient\" in \"gradient boosting\" refers to the fact that we'll use [gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent) on the loss function to determine the parameters in this new model.*)\n- Finally, we add the new model to ensemble, and ...\n- ... repeat!\n\n![tut6_boosting](https://i.imgur.com/MvCGENh.png)\n\n\n# Example\n\nWe begin by loading the training and validation data in `X_train`, `X_valid`, `y_train`, and `y_valid`.

Early stopping causes the model to stop iterating when the validation score stops improving, even if we aren't at the hard stop for `n_estimators`.  It's smart to set a high value for `n_estimators` and then use `early_stopping_rounds` to find the optimal time to stop iterating.\n\nSince random chance sometimes causes a single round where validation scores don't improve, you need to specify a number for how many rounds of straight deterioration to allow before stopping.  Setting `early_stopping_rounds=5` is a reasonable choice.  In this case, we stop after 5 straight rounds of deteriorating validation scores.\n\nWhen using `early_stopping_rounds`, you also need to set aside some data for calculating the validation scores - this is done by setting the `eval_set` parameter.  \n\nWe can modify the example above to include early stopping:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\nmy_model = XGBRegressor(n_estimators=500)\nmy_model.fit(X_train, y_train, \n             early_stopping_rounds=5, \n             eval_set=[(X_valid, y_valid)],\n             verbose=False)","metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-26T19:00:14.112662Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-26T19:00:14.113113Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-26T19:00:14.376626Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-26T19:00:14.113066Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-26T19:00:14.375594Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":5,"outputs":[{"execution_count":5,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"XGBRegressor(base_score=0.5, booster='gbtree', colsample_bylevel=1,\n             colsample_bynode=1, colsample_bytree=1, gamma=0, gpu_id=-1,\n             importance_type='gain', interaction_constraints='',\n             learning_rate=0.300000012, max_delta_step=0, max_depth=6,\n             min_child_weight=1, missing=nan, monotone_constraints='()',\n             n_estimators=500, n_jobs=4, num_parallel_tree=1, random_state=0,\n             reg_alpha=0, reg_lambda=1, scale_pos_weight=1, subsample=1,\n             tree_method='exact', validate_parameters=1, verbosity=None)"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"If you later want to fit a model with all of your data, set `n_estimators` to whatever value you found to be optimal when run with early stopping.\n\n### `learning_rate`\n\nInstead of getting predictions by simply adding up the predictions from each component model, we can multiply the predictions from each model by a small number (known as the **learning rate**) before adding them in.  \n\nThis means each tree we add to the ensemble helps us less.  So, we can set a higher value for `n_estimators` without overfitting.  If we use early stopping, the appropriate number of trees will be determined automatically.\n\nIn general, a small learning rate and large number of estimators will yield more accurate XGBoost models, though it will also take the model longer to train since it does more iterations through the cycle.
