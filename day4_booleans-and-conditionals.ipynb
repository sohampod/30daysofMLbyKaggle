That's why the first expression above is `True`. If we evaluated it from left to right, we would have calculated `True or True` first (which is `True`), and then taken the `and` of that result with `False`, giving a final value of `False`.\n\nYou could try to [memorize the order of precedence](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedence), but a safer bet is to just use liberal parentheses. Not only does this help prevent bugs, it makes your intentions clearer to anyone who reads your code. \n\nFor example, consider the following expression:\n\n```python\nprepared_for_weather = have_umbrella or rain_level < 5 and have_hood or not rain_level > 0 and is_workday\n```\n\nI'm trying to say that I'm safe from today's weather....\n- if I have an umbrella...\n- or if the rain isn't too heavy and I have a hood...\n- otherwise, I'm still fine unless it's raining *and* it's a workday\n\nBut not only is my Python code hard to read, it has a bug. We can address both problems by adding some parentheses:\n\n```python\nprepared_for_weather = have_umbrella or (rain_level < 5 and have_hood) or not (rain_level > 0 and is_workday)\n```\n\nYou can add even more parentheses if you think it helps readability:\n\n```python\nprepared_for_weather = have_umbrella or ((rain_level < 5) and have_hood) or (not (rain_level > 0 and is_workday))\n```\n\nWe can also split it over multiple lines to emphasize the 3-part structure described above:\n\n```python\nprepared_for_weather = (\n    have_umbrella \n    or ((rain_level < 5) and have_hood) \n    or (not (rain_level > 0 and is_workday))\n)\n```","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Conditionals\n\nBooleans are most useful when combined with *conditional statements*, using the keywords ``if``, ``elif``, and ``else``.\n\nConditional statements, often referred to as *if-then* statements, let you control what pieces of code are run based on the value of some Boolean condition.\nHere's an example:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def inspect(x):\n    if x == 0:\n        print(x, \"is zero\")\n    elif x > 0:\n        print(x, \"is positive\")\n    elif x < 0:\n        print(x, \"is negative\")\n    else:\n        print(x, \"is unlike anything I've ever seen...\")\n\ninspect(0)\ninspect(-15)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-06T13:56:15.284934Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-06T13:56:15.285339Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-06T13:56:15.292969Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-06T13:56:15.285305Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-06T13:56:15.291838Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":8,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"0 is zero\n-15 is negative\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The ``if`` and ``else`` keywords are often used in other languages; its more unique keyword is ``elif``, a contraction of \"else if\".\nIn these conditional clauses, ``elif`` and ``else`` blocks are optional; additionally, you can include as many ``elif`` statements as you would like.\n\nNote especially the use of colons (``:``) and whitespace to denote separate blocks of code.
